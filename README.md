        ||RECORD ENTRY SYSTEM||

The objective of the record entry
system is to develop a login-based
record keeping system, which has nested
menus and different interfaces for 
different sets of users.

The application contains separate 
interfaces defined for an administrator 
and employees. The application provides a 
basic menu, which has menu options for 
both types of users. According to the 
selection made by a user, the user is 
prompted to enter his login name and 
password. On successfully validating 
the user name and password, a menu is 
displayed to the user according to his 
level. For example, an employee after 
logging into the system, can record his 
Log In and Log Out timings.

The project demonstrates working with date 
and time in C, showing **' characters 
when user types the password, user 
authentication and two levels of menus 
for each type of user. The project also 
adds validations on user input to ensure 
proper data entry into the database.

The project uses various C concepts, 
such as while loop, if statement and 
switch case statement to display the 
required functionality.
