Here are some things, which I want to implement in due course of time!

- ~Let user choose option to who wants X and who wants 0.~

- Make it two way-game, Computer vs Human and Human vs Human.

- ~Maintain a Leader-Board for all players who have played.~

- Add more graphics, to enjoy user-interface.
